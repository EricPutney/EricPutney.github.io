						<h3>about me</h3>
						<p>Grew up in Vancouver, Washington. Lived in Albuquerque, New Mexico for undergrad and moved to
							New Brunswick, New Jersey for graduate school. I spend a lot of my time thinking about
							physics, but I also like to build things and explore the wide world of the open source
							community.

					<h3>research</h3>
					<p>I use astronomy to probe the properties of <em>dark matter</em> - a material we know
						next to nothing about - yet we know that it pulled galaxies together and built the universe as
						we
						see it.
						<br><br>
						My Ph.D. adviser is Dr. <a href="http://www.physicsmatt.com">Matthew Buckley</a>.
						We work with stellar kinematic data from the Gaia space observatory to build the most accurate
						model of our local region of the galaxy. Recently, we have been interested in developing novel
						machine learning techniques to learn the phase space distribution of stars in a completely
						data-driven way. This assumption-free model of the phase space distribution can be used to solve
						many problems in galactic dynamics in a new light, such as new accurate measurements of the
						local
						dark matter density.

									Summary: In this paper, we demonstrate that normalizing flows are capable of modeling the
									complex 6-dimensional phase space of a simulated Milky Way-like galaxy (<a href="https://nbody.shop/data.html">h277</a>). We also show that our normalizing flow model is capable of accurately recovering the galactic acceleration and mass density field.

									Summary: We applied the methods developed in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01129">arXiv:2205.01129</a> to <a href="https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/dr3">Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3)</a>, the most complete survey of stars in our galactic neighborhood. We measured a local dark matter density of about .47 GeV/cc, or about half of a proton of dark matter per cubic centimeter!

								<h4>Rutgers Physics and Astronomy Graduate Student Organization</h4>
								<p>
									I became Co-President in Fall 2023, and will serve until May 2024. I organize Student Seminars in Physics and Astronomy at Rutgers (SSPAR) seminars, barbeques, and any other events that serve our graduate student community.

								<h4>3D Printing and Robotics</h4>
								<p>I'm interested in how things are made. How much time and how many resources does it take to design and make a thing? I bought an ender 3 v2 3d printer near the end of lockdown so I could do something besides homework and research, and I've been working on a few different projects since then. On the left I've pictured one of the few projects I've actually finished: a BB-8 styled astromech that I designed completely from scratch. His name is NU-7 (or nut, given the pistachio green color).</p>

I served as a picket captain for our Spring 2023 strike, where we fought back against Rutgers central administration and withheld our labor to negotiate a fair contract. I now serve as a union representative for the department of Physics and Astronomy to continue to organize for our upcoming 2026 contract negotiations.</p>
